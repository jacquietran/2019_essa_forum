What is the **decision** in need of evidence? (the motivating question)

--

How will you make the decision with **no additional information**?

--

How would you make the decision if you had access to **any information you wanted**?

--

Can you get **access** to all the data you ideally want to make your decision?

--

What **mistakes** are you willing to live with?

# Coding with data

---

## Excel: Its power and its pitfalls

--

1. Data, analysis outputs, and visualisation are **stored in one file**.

--

2. Data is **easily manipulated** - high risk of introducing errors.

--

3. Point-and-click interface - **manual repetition!**

--

4. **Actions are not logged** by default.

--

5. **Slow** when working with large data sets or files storing many computations.

--

6. Complicated **workbooks can 'break' when shared** with others.

---

## The case for coding

--

1. **Separation** of data, analysis outputs, visualisations, and reports.

--

2. **Reproducible**, transparent, and less error-prone workflow.

--

3. Coding methods are **faster** than point-and-click as your **data gets bigger**, your **actions more repetitive**, and your **analyses more sophisticated**.

--

4. Procedures are **documented** via scripts and command history.

--

5. **Build your own library** of frequently used analytical procedures - or use and adapt libraries created by open source developers!

## **How many gold medals** were won by
## **Canada, Norway, and Sweden** at the
## **last five Winter Olympic Games**, up to 2014?

---

<br />
To answer this question, we will use R to create this **data table**...

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacquietran/2019_essa_forum/master/images/demo1_data_table.PNG)

---

<br />
...and this **data plot**!

## Import the data

``` {r demo1_import_data_part_1a, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# The {here} package helps point to a PROJECT-specific file directory,
# rather than a location specific to YOUR personal computer, like:
# C:\Users\Jacquie\Documents
library(here) #<<

# The {readr} package is efficient for reading (importing) CSVs
library(readr) #<<

# Import the data into your R session
winter <- read_csv(
  here("data/winter.csv"), col_names = TRUE, col_types = NULL)

```

---

## Import the data

``` {r demo1_import_data_part_1b, eval = FALSE}

# The {here} package helps point to a PROJECT-specific file directory,
# rather than a location specific to YOUR personal computer, like:
# C:\Users\Jacquie\Documents
library(here)

# The {readr} package is efficient for reading (importing) CSVs
library(readr)

# Import the data into your R session
winter <- read_csv(                                            #<<
  here("data/winter.csv"), col_names = TRUE, col_types = NULL) #<<

```

---

## Check the data

``` {r demo1_check_data, eval = FALSE}

head(winter)

```

--

``` {r demo1_check_data_eval, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}

# This code chunk won't show on the slide but
# the code will evaluate to print the first 6 rows of data
# allowing for separation of the code chunk from its result
head(winter)

```

---

## Subset the data

Remember our motivating question: **How many gold medals** were won by **Canada, Norway, and Sweden** at the **last five Winter Olympic Games**, up to 2014?

--

We need to subset the data to focus only on:

- Gold medal results

--

- Athletes from Canada (CAN), Norway (NOR), or Sweden (SWE), and

--

- Results from the five Winter Olympics between 1998 to 2014, inclusive.

---

## Subset the data

``` {r demo1_subset_data_part_1, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# The {dplyr} package includes useful data manipulation functions
library(dplyr) #<<

# Subset the data
gold_medal_comparison <- winter %>%
  filter(Medal == "Gold"
         & Country %in% c("CAN", "NOR", "SWE")
         & Year >= 1998)

```

---

## Subset the data

``` {r demo1_subset_data_part_2, eval = FALSE}

# The {dplyr} package includes useful data manipulation functions
library(dplyr)

# Subset the data
gold_medal_comparison <- winter %>%            #<<
  filter(Medal == "Gold"
         & Country %in% c("CAN", "NOR", "SWE")
         & Year >= 1998)

```

---

## Subset the data

``` {r demo1_subset_data_part_3, eval = FALSE}

# The {dplyr} package includes useful data manipulation functions
library(dplyr)

# Subset the data
gold_medal_comparison <- winter %>%
  filter(Medal == "Gold"                       #<<
         & Country %in% c("CAN", "NOR", "SWE") #<<
         & Year >= 1998)                       #<<

```

---

## Check the data

``` {r demo1_check_subset}

head(gold_medal_comparison,
     n = 9) #<<

```

---

## Wrangle the data

In the `winter` data set, the data is structured such that **one row is one medal-winning athlete**.

However...

--

- Team events (e.g., bobsleigh, curling) comprise multiple athletes, and

--

- Within teams that achieve a podium finish, each athlete is awarded a medal.

--

For this analysis, we need to wrangle the data to get it into a format where **one row represents one gold medal per event** (rather than per athlete).

---

## Create a new 'identifier' variable

``` {r demo1_wrangle_data_part_1}

gold_medal_comparison$unique_event_ID <- #<<
  paste(gold_medal_comparison$Year,
        gold_medal_comparison$Sport,
        gold_medal_comparison$Discipline,
        gold_medal_comparison$Country,

## Calculate gold medal totals

Now that we have tidied up the data into the format we need, we can calculate the **total number of gold medals** won by **Canada, Norway, and Sweden** at each of the **Winter Games between 1998 and 2014**.

---

## Calculate gold medal totals

``` {r demo1_summary_stats_part_1a, message = FALSE}

# Calculate total number of gold medals per team per Winter Games
gold_medal_totals <- gold_medal_comparison %>%    #<<
  group_by(Year, City, Country) %>%
  summarise(gold_medal_total = length(Medal)) %>%
  ungroup()

```

---

## Calculate gold medal totals

``` {r demo1_summary_stats_part_1b, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

# Calculate total number of gold medals per team per Winter Games
gold_medal_totals <- gold_medal_comparison %>%
  group_by(Year, City, Country) %>%               #<<
  summarise(gold_medal_total = length(Medal)) %>%
  ungroup()

```

---

## Calculate gold medal totals

``` {r demo1_summary_stats_part_1c, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

# Calculate total number of gold medals per team per Winter Games
gold_medal_totals <- gold_medal_comparison %>%
  group_by(Year, City, Country) %>%
  summarise(gold_medal_total = length(Medal)) %>% #<<
  ungroup()

```

---

## Calculate gold medal totals

``` {r demo1_summary_stats_part_1d, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

# Calculate total number of gold medals per team per Winter Games
gold_medal_totals <- gold_medal_comparison %>%
  group_by(Year, City, Country) %>%
  summarise(gold_medal_total = length(Medal)) %>%
  ungroup()                                       #<<

```

---

## Calculate gold medal totals

When we check the data, we can see it is in long format:

``` {r demo1_summary_stats_part1e}

gold_medal_totals

```

---

## Reshape gold medal totals

We can reshape the data from long to wide format, to make it more **human-readable** when we display the gold medal totals in a table.

``` {r demo1_summary_stats_part2a, warning = FALSE}

# The {tidyr} package helps to convert between
# long and wide data formats
library(tidyr) #<<

# Spread the data from long to wide format for tabulating
gold_medal_totals_wide <- gold_medal_totals %>%
  spread(key = Country, value = gold_medal_total)

```

---

## Reshape gold medal totals

We can reshape the data from long to wide format, to make it more **human-readable** when we display the gold medal totals in a table.

# The {tidyr} package helps to convert between
# long and wide data formats
library(tidyr)

# Spread the data from long to wide format for tabulating
gold_medal_totals_wide <- gold_medal_totals %>%   #<<

```

---

## Reshape gold medal totals

``` {r demo1_summary_stats_part_2}

# Check the reshaped data
gold_medal_totals_wide

```

--

``` {r demo1_summary_stats_part_3}

# NAs appear because SWE did not win any gold medals
# at the 1998 and 2002 Winter Games

# Replace NAs with zeroes
gold_medal_totals_wide[is.na(gold_medal_totals_wide)] <- 0 #<<

```

---

## Display gold medal totals

``` {r demo1_summary_stats_part_4a, eval = FALSE}

# The {DT} package is used to display interactive tables in HTML documents
library(DT) #<<

# Display the totals in a table, with nicer column names
datatable(gold_medal_totals_wide,
          rownames = FALSE,
          options = list(dom = "t"))

```

---

## Display gold medal totals

``` {r demo1_summary_stats_part_4b, eval = FALSE}

# The {DT} package is used to display interactive tables in HTML documents
library(DT)

# Display the totals in a table, with nicer column names
datatable(gold_medal_totals_wide,    #<<
          rownames = FALSE,
          options = list(dom = "t"))

```

---

## Display gold medal totals

``` {r demo1_summary_stats_part_4c, eval = FALSE}

# The {DT} package is used to display interactive tables in HTML documents
library(DT)

# Display the totals in a table, with nicer column names
datatable(gold_medal_totals_wide,
          rownames = FALSE,          #<<
          options = list(dom = "t")) #<<

```

---

## Display gold medal totals

``` {r demo1_summary_stats_part_5, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# This code chunk won't display on the slide but
# the code will evaluate to display summary stats
# in an interactive HTML table
library(DT)

datatable(gold_medal_totals_wide,
          rownames = FALSE,
          options = list(dom = "t"))

```

---

## Plot the data

We can also plot the gold medal totals we've calculated, which will make it easier to draw visual comparisons between countries and over time.

--

Remember our motivating question: **How many gold medals** were won by **Canada, Norway, and Sweden** at the **last five Winter Olympic Games**, up to 2014?

---

<br />
...we can use the table of gold medal totals to produce **this plot**, using a popular R package called `ggplot2`:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacquietran/2019_essa_forum/master/images/demo1_data_plot.png)

---

## gg = Grammar of Graphics

``` {r load_ggplot2, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# The {ggplot2} package is a powerful, feature-rich
# R package for creating data visualisations
library(ggplot2)

```

`ggplot2` draws upon a **layered Grammar of Graphics** as a theoretical foundation for how to make plots (Wilkinson et al., 2005; Wickham, 2010).

---
class: center, middle

``` {r demo1_display_plot_1b, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 16, fig.height = 7.5}

# This code chunk will evaluate but not display

```

It's a start, but...

---

## Areas for improvement

Show countries side-by-side (rather than stacked)

--

Informative plot and axis titles

--

Clearer axis breaks

--

Colourblind-friendly palette

--

Larger font sizes

---

## Countries shown side-by-side

To the previous code chunk we started as the base for this plot, we **add layers** to specify modifications to the plot:

``` {r demo1_build_plot_part_2, eval = FALSE}

p <- p + facet_wrap(~Country, nrow = 1)

```

---
class: center, middle

``` {r demo1_display_plot_2, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 16, fig.height = 7.5}

# Build plot
p <- ggplot(data = gold_medal_totals,
            aes(x = Year, y = gold_medal_total,
                fill = Country))
p <- p + geom_bar(stat = "identity")
p <- p + facet_wrap(~Country, nrow = 1)

# Display plot
p

```

A bit better, but now the legend is redundant, so we can add it to our 'to do' list.

  axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r = 15, unit = "pt"))) #<<

```

## Among **Australians aged 15 years and older**,
## **how much physical activity** do they engage in
## (**minutes per week**)?

To answer this question, we will use R to create this **data plot**:

---

## Import the data

The Australian Bureau of Statistics typically provides data sets in _.xls_ format (MS Excel 1997-2003 spreadsheet).

``` {r demo2_import_data_part1}

# If we were starting a new R session, we would need to
# re-load the {here} package using the command
# library(here) #<<

# The {readxl} R package efficiently imports Excel spreadsheets into R
library(readxl)

```

# re-load the {here} package using the command
# library(here)

# The {readxl} R package efficiently imports Excel spreadsheets into R
library(readxl) #<<

```

---

## Import the data

``` {r demo2_import_data_part3, message = FALSE}

# Import the data into your R session
activity_data <- read_excel(
  here("data/4364055001do013_20172018.xls"),
